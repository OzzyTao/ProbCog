1.2.0  (unreleased)
	* MLNs (Python)
		- cleaned up differentiation between mrf & mln, fixing remaining references
		- grounding
			* modularisation of grounding methods to support 
			* added custom grounding method for BPLL/WCSP
			* fixed grounding of EXIST
			* added grounding method where ground formulas are not collected but can be iterated on demand
		- learning
			* made BPLL more efficient and more memory-efficent 
			* added new learning method BPLL_CG based on custom grounding
			* fixed numeric issues in PLL
			* added learning method DBPLL (discriminative pseudologlikelihood with blocking)
			* added learning method DPLL_ISE_ME (discriminative pseudologlikelihood learning with independent soft evidence, memory-efficent)
			* fixed MultipleDatabaseLearner (was broken by explicit closed-world assumption just prior to v1.0 release)
			* fixed Gaussian prior
		- inference
			* fixed handling of soft evidence in EnumerationAsk
		- logic
			* Handle corner case where no clauses remain in Conjunction.toCNF
		- databases
			* optimised reading of databases with large domains or a large number of soft evidence items
			* allow to instantiate databases directly from string content
	* Datagen (Python)
		- fixed SelN
	* SRLDB (Java)
		- fixed auto-detection of Boolean domains for MLN database generation
	* BLNs (Java)
		- allow BLNLearner and BLNinfer to be more conveniently parametrised/configured 
		- fixed support for logical variables appearing in hard constraints
	* Logging under Java: Added PrintLogger to unify console output and logging for stand-alone and library usage
	* MLNs (Java)
		- inference
			* applied PrintLogger in SampleSAT/MaxWalkSAT and 
			* added time-limited mode to Toulbar2 inference
			* MaxWalkSAT
				- use specific negation mode prior to CNF conversion in order to avoid splits at conjunctions where possible
				- optimisations to avoid unnecessary iterations over the set of constraints
	* Switched to Maven-based build, altering directory structure
	* Switched to Java 9

1.0.0  2012-03-09
  * First official release after development at TUM since 2007
